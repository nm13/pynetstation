# pynetstation

A Python module to communicate with EGI NetStation, similar to C++ [libnetstation](http://code.google.com/p/libnetstation/) library.

Besides been used by the author -- apparently it was successfully used at least in some student projects, completely without any intervention from the author ( I was not even aware of that then, actually ). So it still may be of some use.
