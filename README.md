# pynetstation

A Python module to communicate with EGI NetStation, similar to C++ [libnetstation](http://code.google.com/p/libnetstation/) library.

Besides been used by the author -- apparently it was successfully used at least in some student projects, completely without any intervention from my side ( I was not even aware of that then, actually ). So it still may be of some use.

Since I don't yet have time to figure out linking between GitHub pages -- here are absolute URLs to the existed wiki :

 - wiki: [wiki](https://github.com/nm13/pynetstation/blob/wiki/ProjectHome.md) -- this was automagically exported ;
 - wayback machine: [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150626115249/https://code.google.com/p/pynetstation/wiki/ShortDescription) -- this may have better formatting .
